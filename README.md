# ProjectEuler

This repository is for code I've written, borrowed, and/or adapted to solve problems in Project Euler.

I am saving it on here for future reference and to discuss coding issues with friends.

If you have come here to find solutions without thinking through the problems, please stop.
However, feel free to get in touch to discuss possible solutiions and ways to improve the code.

Thanks!
